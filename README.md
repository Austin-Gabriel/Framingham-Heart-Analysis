Unlocking Heart Health Insights: A Data-Driven Journey through Framingham ðŸ«€

# This Code Is an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Identification of Risk Factors of Heart Disease

The primary objective of the Framingham Heart Study is to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to track their influence over time. 
The study has helped identify several major risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. 

These risk factors, collectively known as the Framingham Risk Factors, are now widely used in clinical practice to assess a person's risk of developing heart disease.
